Over the course of two semesters we worked together as a team of eight students to develop an autonomously guided parachute recovery system for a student competition rocket.
The project took part in the student rocket association ARIS but also served as an intricate part of the final year of the mechanical engineering undergraduate program at ETH Zurich.

More about the project on the <a href="https://aris-space.ch/phoenix-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official ARIS website</a>.

Group work with Alexander Hansson, Lukas Vogel, Sabrina Bodmer, Maximilian Knill, Pascal Sutter, Helvijs Kiselis and Ramon Epprecht.
