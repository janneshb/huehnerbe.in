excerpt: 'We modeled the outbreak of an influenza strain for a community that consists of two belief groups regarding vaccination ("trusters" and "skepticals"). The disease spreads according to an SIVR-model taking into account the decisions of the individual agents whether to vaccinate or not, which follow a simple game theoretical approach.'

In this thesis, the outbreak of an influenza strain is modelled for a community that consists of two belief groups regarding vaccination (’Trusters’ and ’Skepticals’ with di↵erent costs of vaccination). Both groups form sub-groups of the community and are assumed to resemble small-world networks, which are further combined.

Relying on an SIVR-model, the spread of the disease is according to the infec- tion rate and the decisions of the individual agents. The agents follow a simple game theoretical model in order to arrive at a decision to vaccinate, taking into account the forecast for a certain period, which is updated regularly.

The main emphasis is being placed on investigating di↵erent distributions of the communities and the e↵ect this has on the disease outbreak. Besides, the outcomes of changing the agent-specific parameters, costs of vaccination, costs of infection and time-horizon, are analysed as well. The results are in line with and confirm previous research. But especially, it is obtained that uptake levels are more sensitive to the share of trusters in the community, compared to the cost-ratios of the individual communities.
