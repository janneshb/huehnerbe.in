My name is Jannes and I am a scientific assistant at the <a href="https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/coa/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chair of Astrodynamics</a> lead by <a href="https://www.marcelloromano.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Marcello Romano</a> at the Technical University of Munich with the goal of obtaining a PhD.

I am a recent graduate from the Master's program <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/studies/master/degree-programmes/engineering-sciences/robotics-systems-and-control.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robotics, Systems and Control</a> at ETH Zurich.
As part of that degree program, I completed my Master's thesis as a visiting student in the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/research/control-and-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Control and Power (CAP) Research Group</a> at Imperial College London under supervision of Prof. Eric Kerrigan.

During my Bachelor's studies in <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/studies/bachelor/bachelors-degree-programmes/engineering-sciences/mechanical-engineering.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mechanical Engineering</a> at ETH Zurich, I participated in a year-long project at the Academic Space Initiative Switzerland (<a href="https://aris-space.ch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARIS</a>) with the goal of developing an autonomous guided recovery system for a student competition rocket.

After completing my Bachelor's degree in 2021 I interned in <a href="https://flyzipline.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zipline's</a> Guidance, Navigation and Control department in South San Francisco, California for a year before returning to Zurich to take on my Master's studies. In April 2024, I moved to London to write my Master's thesis at Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Eric Kerrigan.

Throughout my studies at ETH Zurich, I supported various lectures as a teaching assistant both behind the scenes and in the class room.
