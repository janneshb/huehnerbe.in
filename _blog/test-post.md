In the second semester of the mechanical engineering Bachelor's program at ETH Zurich students form groups and compete against each other in a hands-on challenge as part of the curriculum.

Over the course of one semester, each group develops a fully functional mechanical system that solves a given task. At the end of the semester, all groups compete in a tournament with a grand finale in the great hall of the ETH main building.

Our team won first place out of more than 500 participating students.
