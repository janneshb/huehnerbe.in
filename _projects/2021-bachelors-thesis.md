excerpt: "In this project I used ALADIN to implement a distributed trajectory planner for multiple aerial vehicles (such as quadcopters) and compared it to more na√Øve approaches as well as the coresponding centralized planner."

Abstract
--------

With an increasing amount of vehicles featuring some degree of autonomy possible interactions between agents must be taken into account to guarantee safe operation within a confined space.

In this Bachelor thesis a centralized planning algorithm was developed that generates safe trajectories for multiple <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRS</a> EmboRockETH agents. Then, this planner was cast into distributed form. Based on the distributed optimization problem decentralized planners were implemented using ALADIN and round-robin scheduling. Finally, the performance of all trajectory planners was evaluated and compared using various problem setups.

This project served as my Bachelor's thesis.
