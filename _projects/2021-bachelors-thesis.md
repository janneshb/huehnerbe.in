excerpt: 'In this project I used ALADIN to implement a distributed trajectory planner for multiple aerial vehicles (such as quadcopters) and compared it to more na√Øve approaches as well as the coresponding centralized planner. This project served as my bachelo\r's thesis.'

With an increasing amount of vehicles featuring some degree of autonomy possible interactions between agents must be taken into account to guarantee safe operation within a confined space.
In this Bachelor thesis a centralized planning algorithm was developed that generates safe trajectories for multiple CRS EmboRockETH agents. Then, this planner was cast into distributed form. Based on the distributed optimization problem decentralized planners were implemented us- ing ALADIN and round-robin scheduling. Finally, the performance of all trajectory planners was evaluated and compared using various problem setups.
